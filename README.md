# TSP Solver

This repository contains a Python script for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using brute force permutation generation and calculating the tour length for different matrices representing city distances.

## Code Overview

The main functionalities of the script are as follows:

1. **calculate_tour_length(matrix, tour):**
   - Calculates the total length of a tour given a distance matrix and a tour order.

2. **generate_permutations(elements):**
   - Generates all possible permutations of a list of elements.

3. **tsp(matrix):**
   - Solves the TSP problem using brute force permutation generation.
   - Finds the tour with the minimum total length.

## Usage

To use the TSP solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fairuzald/Challenge_13522057
   ```
2. Move directory
```bash
   cd Challenge_13522057
```
3. Move directory
```bash
   python challenge.py
```
